# Hello-World

Still can't decide between learning Phython or JavaScript to practice web dev first...
Will probably end up trying Django to easily edit/update a MySQL db then see if I can make an android app that uses the same db.
Sorry that my limited knowledge on the subject shows.

If anyone ever reads this and is willing to help me out, 

I could really benifit from a discussion on web frameworks and why you personally choose to use the one you use.
